Vehicle Routing Constraints Module

This module defines the constraints for solving vehicle routing problems using Timefold's `ConstraintFactory`.
The constraints are divided into two categories: **Hard Constraints** and **Soft Constraints**. Hard constraints must be satisfied,
while soft constraints represent optimization goals that should be minimized but can be violated.

Hard Constraints:
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Ensure that a vehicle's load does not exceed its capacity.
- **Service Finished After Max End Time**: Penalize when the service is finished after the customer's latest acceptable time.
- **Prioritize Older Dates**: Prioritize customers with older service requests.

Soft Constraints:
- **Minimize Travel Distance**: Minimize the total travel distance of all vehicles.
- **Minimize Travel Time**: Minimize the total travel time of all vehicles.

The `define_constraints` function acts as the main entry point for the constraint provider, integrating all constraints defined below.

Functions:
----------
- `define_constraints`: Provides the list of constraints used for vehicle routing.
- `vehicle_capacity`: Ensures that vehicle load does not exceed its capacity.
- `service_finished_after_max_end_time`: Penalizes when service is completed after the customerâ€™s acceptable end time.
- `prioritize_older_dates`: Penalizes lower-priority customers in favor of older service requests.
- `minimize_travel_distance`: Minimizes the total travel distance for all vehicles.
- `minimize_travel_time`: Minimizes the total travel time for all vehicles.
